# SYNOPSIS
Style build tool

# DESCRIPTION
Script takes internal styles as a base, and a path (provided as an argument),
to collect styles source code and compile output to the specified destination.

# INSTALL

```bash
npm install optoolco/styles
```

# USAGE
In the package.json of your project, add a script that calls this script and
provide the source of your styles and the destination for your css.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:styles": "./style ./src/index.styl ./static/css/index.css"
  }
}
```

# NOTE
Paths that include `{{static}}` will be replaced with the absolute url that points to the resource at runtime (not build time).

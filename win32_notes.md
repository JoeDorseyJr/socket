# Notes
Setting up a windows development machine

Download LLVM latest, Clang-12
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-12.0.0

Download and install git
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.31.1.windows.1/Git-2.31.1-64-bit.exe

## For building the DLLs

Install Choco (the windows package manager)
https://chocolatey.org/install

Install `vswhere` (why this is unbundled blows my mind)
https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vswhere

Install Visual Studio Code and the Visual Studio Build Tools

# Building apps

Unlike electron, Opkit provides a build tool that can build,
package and code-sign for all 3 major operating systems.

## Command

The build tool can be installed globally with the `bootstrap.sh`
script. The script should install a binary called `opkit` which
is placed in `/usr/local/bin` or `C:\Program Files`, so it should
be in your path. Run the command with the `-h` flag to get help.

```sh
opkit -h
```

## Configuration Files

The build tool expects to find two config files in the
target directory, `settings.config` and `menu.config`.

### Settings Configuration

### Menu Configuration Syntax

End menus with `;`. Split menus and menu items with `:`. See the
docs for an example of a menu.

```syntax
Menu A:
  Item 1: Accellerator
  Item 2: Accellerator
  Item 2: Accellerator;
Menu B:
  Item: Accellerator;
Menu C:
  Menu Item: Accellerator
```

## Troubleshooting your C++ toolchain

The latest version of MacOS should have everything you need. But
on Linux you may need to update some packages. To ensure you have
the latest clang compiler and libraries you can try the follwing...

For debian/ubuntu, before you install the packages, you may want
to [add][0] these software update repos [here][1] to the software
updater.

```sh
sudo apt install \
  build-essential \
  clang-12 \
  libc++1-12-dev \
  libc++abi-12-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
```

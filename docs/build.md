# Building apps

Unlike electron, there is an official build tool built into
Opkit. It can build, package and code-sign for all 3 major
operating systems.

## Command

The build tool can be installed globally with the `bootstrap.sh`
script. The script should install a binary called `opkit` which
is placed in `/usr/local/bin` or `C:\Program Files`, so it should
be in your path. Run the command with the `-h` flag to get help.

```sh
opkit -h
```

## Configuration Files

The build tool expects to find two config files in the
target directory, `settings.config` and `menu.config`.

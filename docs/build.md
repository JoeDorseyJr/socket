# Building apps

Opkit provides a cli that can build, package and code-sign for
`win32`, `macOS` and `linux`.

## Command

The CLI can be installed globally with the `bootstrap.sh` script.
The script should install a binary called `opkit` which is placed
in `/usr/local/bin` or `C:\Program Files`, so it should be in your
path. Run the command with the `-h` flag to get help.

```sh
opkit -h
```

If the CLI tool is failing, see the [trouble shooting guide][0].

## Configuration Files

The build tool expects to find a config file in the
target directory, `settings.config`.

### Settings Configuration

`input` is a directory is where your application's code
is located. The `build` string is shell code that the CLI
tool will run for you.
